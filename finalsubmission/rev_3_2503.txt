This is a much improved version of the paper, I'm happy to see it accepted. The
models are perhaps not quite as tightly linked to the literature review as they
were before, now that the copy-high-payoff-traits (direct bias) has been
replaced with copy-if-better (more of a context bias, similar to copy-the-best).
But it's much clearer and neater now.
Some minor points:
1. Collard (2013) should be Collard et al. (2013) throughout.
2. First line: "Social learning is one of the key processes underlying the
   spread of cultural traits in a living population" - surely it's the only
   process by which cultural traits spread, by definition.
3. The 'textbook definition' of social learning from Mesoudi on p.4 ("people
   preferentially choose among existing traits found in the population without
   changing those traits") was actually for content/direct biased social
   learning, not social learning in all its forms. Guided variation (as
   mentioned later) is another form of social learning that does change traits.
